### Question 1 (5 points)

Following up with the derivation of the conditional distribution of the multivariate Gaussian distribution, now assume that rather that the mean values being &mu;<sub>1</sub> and &mu;<sub>2</sub> respectively that there are covariates such that the mean values are now X<sub>1</sub>&beta; and X<sub>2</sub>&beta;. What are the conditional mean and variance in this situation?

### Question 2 (5 points)

This conditional distribution will require an estimate for &beta;. Describe in general terms how that might happen.

### Question 3 (15 points)

Simulate 15 data points from a two-dimensional normal distribution. You can use the covariance function of your choice, but it should include a nugget term. Then use your results from question 1 to fit a conditional mean and interval for gridded points in the spatial range. For now, you can assume that &beta; and the parameters in the covariance function are known. Create a set of figures that contain your conditional mean with some sort of uncertainty.
